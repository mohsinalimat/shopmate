#  shopmate

## Architecture
shopmate is built in [Clean Swift](https://clean-swift.com) with a custom design.

I remove `Presenter` in clean swift and connect directly `View Controller` to `Interactor`. This change makes the architecture becomes very flexible to change the requirements.   

## Technique 
Using Auto Layout Programmatically instead of Interface Builder. I use my own library to build this. Check it out [here](https://www.codementor.io/nguyentruongky33/starting-auto-layout-programmatically-r43vwn0po).

UI implementation with `knStaticListController` (detail is [here](https://www.codementor.io/nguyentruongky33/implement-flexible-ui-with-uitableview-slww3uor5)). This skill helps to build UI flexibly and fast.
